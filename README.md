# Generative-model
Detailed documentation of my own important process of learning to generate models. Includes historically reproduced code sets and innovations in my work.

The branches are model-specific codes. The following is categorized by key theoretical models and practical problem models. The categorization will increase as the code is updated. 
Key theoretical models:
