## Motivation

Hyperspectral imaging allows remote sensing experts to access the spectral signatures of the materials on the ground.
This makes hyperspectral cameras the perfect tools for land cover mapping. However, available hyperspectral datasets are rare
and weakly labeled. This makes training data hungry algorithms on such datasets challenging.

In this work, we investigate the use of Generative Adversarial Networks for hyperspectral sample synthesis.

## Code

This Jupyter notebook relies on PyTorch and implements a [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) using an auxiliary classifier.
